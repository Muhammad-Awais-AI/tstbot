In the event Sherpa Markets (or our clearing/prime counter-party institutions) went in to bankruptcy the company would go in to special administration and would have an authorized insolvency practitioner appointed to administer and return all assets back to their clients. There may be fees associated with this, and time delays for the administration. \\n\\nWhat are the odds of this happening? \\n\\nAlthough we feel that this situation would be extremely rare (given our safeguards and overall risk-adverse business model) it would be unprofessional for us to deny that this is of course possible, just as it is with any corporation. \\n\\nFor clarification purposes however (and to justify why we feel this would be a rare occurrence), Sherpa Markets assumes very, very, little risk as a brokerage and financial technology provider: especially when contrasted vs most retail market making shops. \\n\\nFor starters, Sherpa Markets passes trades directly through to the market in an agency only model, and does not run a risk book (b-book) in any form. We do not assume ANY hedging risk and serve as an intermediary clearing agent only. \\n\\nWe also offer multiple license/regulatory regimes, and different clearing products and liquidity streams to provide options to our clients (and not force a single path upon them). \\n\\nFurthermore, Sherpa Markets is not over-leveraged and issues VERY low leverage across all of our currency coverage accounts (our exposure is very, very low vs competitor FCMs). \\n\\nSherpa Markets also designs, deploys, and utilizes smart risk management tools, protocols, and software (some of which we have custom designed), and which are also available in conjunction with our Prime Partners to keep us safe. \\n\\nSo while there may always be unavoidable market risks which may remain out of our control, we have designed our entire business model to defend against these, so that we and our clients remain as safe and protected as possible. \\n\\nThis combined with a strong brand recognition, a strong industry reputation for backing our clients, a team with decades of industry experience, and strong/reliable counter-party partners, prime partners, and technology providers, all helps to keep us in a position of prominence within the industry and ensure that we all have a healthy future ahead.\""

          \n\nLeverage can exponentially increase your profits as well as your losses so its crucial that traders take care when using leverage. The larger your position size, the larger your pip value will be and therefore, the greater the impact on your profit/loss (P/L).
          \n\nMargin means the amount of money that you need to deposit into your Account to enter into or maintain a contract with us under the Agreements.
          \n\nMargin requirements are expressed as a percentage of the full amount i.e. 0.5%, 2%, 1%. You can use this percentage to calculate your maximum leverage in your trading account.

          \n\nAs a broker that sends trades to the market, we are not able to provide the same high leverages that market maker brokers offer due to our Prime Broker relationship.
          \n\nIts important to note that if positions are being carried over a news announcement/weekend and the market gaps and your account balance goes negative you will be required to deposit funds to bring the account balance back to 0. Weve only seen this happen a few times, usually over a weekend gap, however in almost all cases it is an account that has asked for higher leverage.
          \n\nOn a B-book broker when an account goes negative, the broker has first of all made the entire deposit as profit and then the negative balance can be reset to 0 as the trades didnt go to market and were internalised. So the broker doesnt owe that money to a counterparty AKA liquidity providers. With us if an account goes negative the trades were executed in the real market so we have real exposure with the Prime Broker and liquidity providers and we would owe that negative balance to those counterparties. So we cant offer negative balance protection like a b-book broker.
          \n\nThe real risk of negative balances is why we dont offer super high leverage like other brokers. You can imagine 1:500 leverage clients would be blowing negative constantly and a b-book broker would love that. If we offered 1:500 like other brokers with our a-book setup then we would be out of business as client accounts would be blowing up left right and center and we would owe all the negative balances to the Prime Broker/Liquidity Providers."

By combining all the required margins you will have a Used Margin of 4,549.21. To get the Margin Level in MT4: assuming your equity hasnt changed from the original balance, divide 10,000 by 4,549.21 and multiply by 100 to get: 10,000 ÷ 4,549.21 x 100 = 219.81%.\""

          "How to calculate margin requirement (in MT4): \n\nPosition value / leverage (e.g.100/200) = Margin required. \n\nRemember to convert back to your account currency.
          \n\nExample (AUD account): 1.3 lots EURUSD with leverage 1:100.
          \n\nStep 1: 1.3 lots X EUR100,000 = EUR130,000 position value. \n\nStep 2: EUR130,000 / 100 (1:100 leverage) = EUR1300. \n\nStep 3: EUR1300 X EURAUD = AUD$2137 Margin required.

          \n\nStop orders: \n\nStop orders are orders that become market orders when the market reaches a designated price.

          "Profit is made by buying low and selling high. If you are bearish, short selling is possible in the FX market. The formula is as follows (excluding commission and daily swap adjustments):
          \n\nProfit / Loss= ( Selling Price - Buying Price ) x Contract Size  \n\nProfit and loss will be in the counter currency of the contract.
          \n\nExample 1 \n\nBought 3 contracts of USD / JPY @116.00 \n\n( i.e. bought USD300,000 against JPY at the price of JPY116 per USD ) \n\nSold 3 contracts of USD / JPY @117.00 \n\n( i.e. sold USD300,000 against JPY at the price of JPY117 per USD ) \n\nProfit / Loss ( JPY )= ( Selling Price- Buying Price ) x Contract Size \n\n= ( 117.00-116.00 ) x 300000 \n\n= JPY300, 000 \n\nTherefore a profit of JPY300, 000 is made.

          "Our oil CFDs are continuous pricing, i.e. non-expiring products that aim to deliver a fair value estimation of the spot oil price, based on a weighted average (according to time of expiry) of the front month and back month futures contracts
          \n\nBenefits: \n\n- No need to roll futures contracts. The liquidity provider gradually transitions open positions to the next available contract as the front month approaches expiry. \n\n- No price spikes that require adjustments due to front month contract expiry. \n\n- Exposure to the underlying spot price movements of oil indices.
          \n\nCalculation: (price of contract a X days remaining in the contract) + (price of contract b X days remaining in the contract) / total days. Liquidity providers also consider variables like liquidity and volatility of underlying markets and adjust prices accordingly."
